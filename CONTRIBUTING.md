# Contributing to Formity

Hi there! We're so glad you're interested in contributing to Formity üòÅ. Your involvement helps us grow and improve ‚Äî thank you for considering joining our journey!

Formity currently provides the **@formity/react** package, and we're excited to expand its functionality to other frameworks like Vue, Angular, and Svelte. If you take a look at **@formity/react**, you'll notice it's a lightweight package ‚Äî most of the logic is handled by **@formity/system**, the core that powers everything. This architecture makes it easier to create similar packages for other frameworks.

If you're experienced with Vue, Angular, Svelte, or another framework and would like to help us build these packages, we'd be thrilled to collaborate with you!

Have ideas for new features or ways to enhance Formity? Awesome! You can reach out to us anytime at [contact@martiserra.me](mailto:contact@martiserra.me). And if you're ready to dive in, feel free to submit a pull request ‚Äî we're always happy to review contributions from the community.

Thank you for making Formity better with your support. We can't wait to see what we build together!
